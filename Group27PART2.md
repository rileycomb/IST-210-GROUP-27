### CATAbus: Blue Loop

It's a very relatable mode of transportation that almost everyone has used at least once, it's already an established business. A typical business day would be running two loops and two links, Blue Loop, White Loop, Red Link, Green Link. each running at different hours. Stopping on different routes, picking up and dropping off students on Penn State campus. Each loop/link has multiple busses running at the same time and each bus has different drivers throughout the day. There are peak times throughout the day where the bus is crowded and other times the bus is empty. After the brainstorm, we have decided to analyze just one CATAbus, the Blue loop. The real-time end user data is still going to be able to let the user know what times of the year/week/day the bus is the most crowded, but now only for one bus system. The data will include information about the students that use the bus and how often they use it. We will look into times a day that the students ride the bus as well as if they are repeat riders every day. The number of students that ride the bus will relate to the data about the blue loop including the max capacity, the loops that it takes around the campus, and the time that it takes to complete those loops. A large constraint about this part of the data is that there is a different number of blue loops running each day and at certain times of the day. When there are more than 3 blue loops running, they can go slower around the loop then if there is just one. There is also more congestion on the streets during school hours. This can hinder the data because the blue loops are going much slower than at night when there is little going on campus. This issue can be looked into further, as there can be more data collected for these issues. This leads to the number of locations that the blue loop has and the time that it spends at each stop, or if it even stops. Another constraint is when the blue loop does not stop at a location because there are no students that need to get off. This creates a faster loop time, and even a blip in the data that can throw it off. The time at each stop relates to the time in general that students are riding the bus as well as the time in between students riding the bus. This will eventually lead to end user data where a person can see on which day, with what weather condition, at what time, and at which stop, the bus will have the most people or the least people on board so they can prepare accordingly. The goal is to create an informational data set that collects information about the students and blue loop to lead to the locations and times that correspond to the busiest times that the bus is operating.


**Tables** 
- **Students:** this table will identify the students riding the bus. We will ask for the year standing, the number of times each student rides the blue loop a day and the number of students that ride the bus. The constraints for this table would be the number of bus trips for students, No less than 0, probably no more than 20.
- **Blup loop:** This table will give information about the blue loop. It will list how many stops that the loop has, the number of students that ride the bus, number of drivers and blue loops in operating throughout the day and the maximum capacity of people that can be on the bus. The constraints for this table are no less than 0 stops and no more than 16 stops. No less than 1 driver and no more than 2. Also no less than 0 passengers and no more than 100. 
- **Location:** This table will take the number of stops that the blue loop has and record the time that it spends at each stop. It will also keep track of the number of times that the blue loop goes to those stops. Constraints would be no less than 0 Loops and no more than 200?. Also no less than 0 seconds per stop and no more than 10 minutes.
- **Time:** This table will look at the time of the day that students are riding the bus. These times can be classified into morning, afternoon and night time. It will also look at the time that is spent at each stop as well as the time that it takes for the blue loop to make a full circle around the stops. The constraints for this table are no less than 5 minutes for a loop and no longer than 30 minutes,
- **Season/Temperature/Weather Conditions:** The last table is taking a look at what time of the year that students are riding the bus. It will also use the time of the day that students are riding the bus and the number of students that are on the bus as well as the temperature, and weather conditions of that time. Constraints are no less than -50 degrees F. no greater than 100 degrees F.
