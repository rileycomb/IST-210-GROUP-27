# Lab 3: Pet Shop ER Diagram

### Description of project

We designed an entity relationship diagram that would keep track of customers, sales and discounts of items in the pet store. The diagram creates a graphic illustration of the database for organizing the pet store sales, purchases and customers. Each table hosts an identifier also known as a primary key. These are all unique from each other and act as the name of the table. There are seven primary keys which include: sales, food, fish, pets, store, customer and discount. Under the primary keys (PK) is a list of attributes, which are characteristics of the that describe instances in the category. There are single-valued attributes that have just one value and multi-valued attributes that act as a category for items to fall under. There are many entities on the diagram, but the flow continues throughout. It is easy to look at the diagram starting from the sales point. In the sales table, we keep track of the sales of food, pets and fish. These values are all foregin keys as they have their own tables connected. Each attribute in this table form a one to many relationships with the other primary keys. This is because there can be multiple items bought during one transaction. There is a table for food which keeps track of the sales of cat food, dog food, fish food and other miscellaneous food. The sales table is also a one to many relationships with fish sales. In this primary table, we keep track of they types of fish sold. There is a similar table that keeps track of the other pet sales that are not fish. In this table we list cats, dogs and rodents. The sales table is also in a one to one relationship with the discount table. This table keeps track of the customers yearly discounts. One discount can be applied per sale. These discounts are in a one to many relationships with the customer table which holds the customer information. This table gives each customer a unique ID that is a one to one relationship with the discounts, as they are specific for each customer. The customers are then in a one to one relationship with the pet store. They are specific to their local store where they do their shopping, but the store is in a one to many relationships with the customers, as they have many customers to the local store. Each of the tables connect to create intersecting relationships. The diagram is attached below and gives a visual as to what the database would look like.
